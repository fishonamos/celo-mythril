3. Basic Solidity programing skills.
4. Understanding of Security concepts in Software Development.

## Introduction:

Digital contracts that self-execute and automatically uphold an agreement's terms and conditions are known as Smart Contracts. They can be used to facilitate and automate a variety of transactions without the use of middlemen because they are driven by blockchain technology.

Smart Contracts have a lot of advantages as well as disadvantages. It is crucial to take steps to secure Smart Contracts since their vulnerabilities could lead to the loss of money or other important assets.

This tutorial will outline the best practices for securing Smart Contracts and shows how to utilize Mythril which is a well-known security tool to protect Smart Contracts on the Celo blockchain.

## Understanding Smart Contracts on the Celo Blockchain:

**[Celo](https://celo.org/)** is a decentralized blockchain network that allows quick, safe and low-cost mobile payments. It is based on Ethereum technology and writes Smart Contracts using a modified version of the Solidity programming language.

Celo blockchain Smart Contracts are similar to Ethereum blockchain Smart Contracts. They are self-executing contracts in which the terms of the parties' agreement are directly written into lines of code. They are immutable and transparent which means that they cannot be modified once deployed and their code can be inspected by anybody.

Celo's Smart Contracts are utilized for a variety of reasons like governance, payments and asset management etc.

## Security Risks in Smart Contracts:

Smart contracts are prone to a number of security issues as follows:

1. **Re-entrancy attacks:** These attacks occur when a contract is called repeatedly before the previous call has finished that results in unanticipated effects.

2. **Integer Overflow and Underflow:** These occur when arithmetic operations result in values that are larger or smaller than the range of the data type used.

3. **Logic errors:** These are mistakes caused by defects in the design or implementation of the Smart Contract code.

4. **Access control issues:** These issues arise when the Smart Contract fails to effectively restrict access to specific functions or data.

5. **Malicious code injection:** When an attacker is able to insert harmful code into the Smart Contract code these attacks might occur.

## Introduction to Mythril:

**[Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril)** is an open-source security analysis tool that detects security vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts written in Solidity. It is easy to use and can be integrated into the development process of Smart Contracts.

Mythril analyzes Smart Contracts via symbolic execution which means it explores all conceivable paths of execution in the code. This enables it to detect security vulnerabilities that manual code review might overlook.

## Installing and Configuring Mythril:

Follow these steps to install Mythril:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/download) 
2. To install [Mythril](https://pypi.org/project/mythril/), open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

    ```bash
        npm install -g mythril
    ```
3. After installing Mythril, you can check if it is installed correctly by running the following command:

    ```bash
        myth -version
    ```

This should return the version of Mythril that is currently installed on your machine.

4. Next, you need to configure Mythril to work with the Celo blockchain. To do this, you need to create a configuration file called `.mythril.yml` in your project directory.
Here is an example configuration file for Celo:

```yaml
default: celo

blockchain:
  celo:
    node:
      rpc: https://forno.celo.org
    contract:
      name: VotingSystem

analysis:
  modules:
    - mythril.analysis.modules.ether.transfer
```

In this configuration file, you specified the Celo node that Mythril should connect to using the RPC URL for the [Celo testnet](https://forno.celo.org). You also specified the contract name for the voting system Smart Contract which you will implement later in this tutorial.

Finally, we include the `ether.transfer` module to enable detection of re-entrancy attacks.

## Analyzing Smart Contracts with Mythril:

To analyze a Smart Contract with Mythril, follow the below steps:

1. Compile the Smart Contract code using the Solidity compiler. You can use a tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.js) or [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/) to do this.

2. Save the compiled bytecode and ABI (Application Binary Interface) in a JSON file.

3. Run the following command to analyze the smart contract with Mythril:

    ```bash
        myth analyze <path_to_json_file>
    ```

This will analyze the smart contract and output any security vulnerabilities detected.

You can also run Mythril in interactive mode by running the following command:

```bash
    myth analyze --mode=interactive <path_to_json_file>
```

This will allow you to step through the analysis process and view detailed information about the vulnerabilities detected.

## Best Practices for Securing Smart Contracts:

To maintain the security of Smart Contracts on the Celo blockchain, the best practices in Smart contract development must be followed. The following are some best practices to follow:

1. **Use standardized libraries:** in order to limit the risk of vulnerabilities, use well-established, open-source libraries for common functionality like token transfers and access control.

2. **Test thoroughly:** Conduct thorough testing of Smart Contracts using tools like [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/), [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.js) and [Mythril](https://pypi.org/project/mythril/) to detect and fix vulnerabilities.

3. **Implement access controls:** Use access controls to restrict access to sensitive functions and data in Smart Contracts.

4. **Use secure coding practices:** Follow secure coding practices such as input validation, error handling and proper variable initialization to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.

5. **Perform regular code reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews of Smart Contracts to detect and fix vulnerabilities.

## Implementing a Voting System Smart Contract on Celo with Mythril:

Letâ€™s now implement a simple voting system Smart Contract on the Celo blockchain and analyze it with Mythril.

First, you have to install hardhat with the following command:

```bash
    npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Then, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal. Run the following command to initialize a new Hardhat project:

```bash
    npx hardhat init
```

Below is the code for the voting system smart contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner; // the address of the contract owner
    mapping(string => uint) public candidateVotes; // mapping of candidate names to vote counts
    string[] public candidateList; // list of all candidate names

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender; // set the contract owner to the address that deployed the contract
    }

    function addCandidate(string memory _candidateName) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can add candidates"); // only the contract owner can add candidates
        require(bytes(_candidateName).length > 0, "Candidate name cannot be empty"); // make sure the candidate name is not empty
        require(candidateVotes[_candidateName] == 0, "Candidate already exists"); // make sure the candidate doesn't already exist
        candidateList.push(_candidateName); // add the candidate name to the list
        candidateVotes[_candidateName] = 0; // set the initial vote count for the candidate to zero
    }

    function voteForCandidate(string memory _candidateName) public {
        require(bytes(_candidateName).length > 0, "Candidate name cannot be empty"); // make sure the candidate name is not empty
        require(candidateVotes[_candidateName] >= 0, "Candidate does not exist"); // make sure the candidate exists
        for (uint i = 0; i < candidateList.length; i++) {
            if (keccak256(bytes(candidateList[i])) == keccak256(bytes(_candidateName))) {
                candidateVotes[_candidateName]++; // increment the vote count for the candidate
                return;
            }
        }
        revert("Candidate does not exist");
    }

    function getCandidateVotes(string memory _candidateName) public view returns (uint) {
        return candidateVotes[_candidateName]; // return the vote count for the specified candidate
    }
}

```

Let's go through the code together:

1. `address public owner`: A state variable stores the address of the owner of the contract. The `public` keyword makes this variable readable by anyone on the blockchain.

2. `mapping(string => uint) public candidateVotes`: Mapping that associates a string (the candidate's name) with a uint (the candidate's vote count). The `public` keyword makes this mapping readable by anyone on the blockchain.

3. `string[] public candidateList`: Array of strings that stores the names of all the candidates. The `public` keyword makes this array readable by anyone on the blockchain.

4. `constructor()`: runs when the contract is first deployed. It sets the `owner` variable to the address of the user who deployed the contract.

5. `function addCandidate(string memory _candidateName) public`: allows the contract owner to add a candidate to the election. It takes a string argument `_candidateName` which is the name of the candidate being added. The `require` statement checks that the function is being called by the owner of the contract and then adds the candidate's name to the `candidateList` array and sets their vote count to 0.

6. `function voteForCandidate(string memory _candidateName) public`: allows anyone to cast a vote for a candidate. It takes a string argument `_candidateName` which is the name of the candidate being voted for. The `require` statements check that the candidate's name is not empty and that the candidate actually exists in the `candidateList` array. If both of these conditions are met, the candidate's vote count is incremented by 1.

7. `function getCandidateVotes(string memory _candidateName) public view returns (uint)`: allows to check the vote count for a specific candidate. It takes a string argument `_candidateName` which is the name of the candidate being queried and returns the candidate's vote count.

## Securing the Smart Contract with Mythril:

Let's now use Mythril to analyze the `votingSymstem.sol` contract for potential security vulnerabilities. Here are the steps:

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the directory where you have saved the Smart Contract code.
2. Run the command myth analyze contracts/VotingSystem.sol.

Mythril will now analyze the Smart Contract and report any potential vulnerabilities. Here is an example of the output:

```vbnet
======= VotingSystem.sol:VotingSystem =======
SWC ID: 101
Severity: Medium
Contract: VotingSystem
Function name: addCandidate
PC address: 155
Description: The Smart Contract allows an arbitrary address to add candidates to the voting system which could potentially allow an attacker to add a malicious candidate.
============

    "issues": [
        {
            "swcID": "SWC-101",
            "severity": "Medium",
            "description": "The smart contract allows an arbitrary address to add candidates to the voting system, which could potentially allow an attacker to add a malicious candidate.",

                        "length": 20,
                        "file": "contracts/VotingSystem.sol"
                    },
                    {
                        "start": 120,
                        "length": 50,
                        "file": "contracts/VotingSystem.sol"
                    },
                    {
                        "start": 173,
                        "length": 15,
                        "file": "contracts/VotingSystem.sol"
                    },
                    {
                        "start": 194,
                        "length": 79
```

Mythril has found a potential vulnerability with the `addCandidate` function in this example. It has been discovered that any address can add a candidate to the voting system, allowing an attacker to install a rogue candidate. This vulnerability has been classified as "Medium" and has been assigned the SWC ID 101.

To rectify this vulnerability, we can modify the `addCandidate` function to only allow the contract owner to add candidates. Here is the updated code:

```solidity
function addCandidate(string memory name) public onlyOwner {
    require(candidates[msg.sender].name == "", "A candidate with this address already exists.");
    candidates[msg.sender] = Candidate(name, 0);
    candidateAddresses.push(msg.sender);
}
```

In this modified code, you have added the `onlyOwner` modifier to the `addCandidate` function. This ensures that only the contract owner can add candidates to the voting system.

We can now run Mythril again to check if there are any more vulnerabilities. Here is the output:

```css
======= VotingSystem.sol:VotingSystem =======

Execution result:
{
    "info": "0 issue(s) found. Scanned 1 contract(s).\n",
    "issues": []
}
```

Mythril has not identified any more vulnerabilities in the Smart Contract hence, indicating that it is now secure for deploying.

## Deploying the Smart Contract to the Celo Blockchain:

Install the `@celo/contractkit` package which will allow us to interact with the Celo blockchain from our Smart Contract. Run the following command to install it:

```bash
    npm install @celo/contractkit
```

Next, you need to configure Hardhat to use the Celo network. In the root directory of your project, create a new file named `hardhat.config.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
// Require the necessary modules and dependencies
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("hardhat");

// Load environment variables from the .env file
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

// Define the Celo testnet network configuration object
const celoTestnet = {
  url: process.env.CELO_TESTNET_RPC_URL, // URL of the Celo testnet RPC endpoint
  accounts: [process.env.CELO_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY], // Private key of the account to use for deploying contracts and transactions
};

// Export the Hardhat configuration object
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    celo: celoTestnet, // Use the Celo testnet network configuration
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.4", // Version of Solidity to use for compiling contracts
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true, // Enable the Solidity optimizer
        runs: 200, // Set the number of runs for the optimizer
      },
    },
  },
  paths: {
    sources: "./contracts", // Path to the contract source files
    tests: "./test", // Path to the test files
    cache: "./cache", // Path to the cache directory
    artifacts: "./artifacts", // Path to the artifacts directory
  },
  namedAccounts: {
    deployer: {
      default: 0, // Use the first account as the default deployer
    },
  },
  mocha: {
    timeout: 20000, // Set the timeout for Mocha tests
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY, // API key for Etherscan verification
  },
  hardhat: {
    gas: "auto", // Set gas limit to auto
    gasPrice: "auto", // Set gas price to auto
  },
};

```

In the above code, we require some Hardhat plugins and define the configuration for the Celo network. We also set the Solidity compiler version, the optimizer settings and the file paths for our project.

We also define some named accounts for deployment and configure the Mocha testing framework. Lastly, we set up the Etherscan API key and the gas and gas price values for our network.

To use the Celo network, we need to set the environment variables `CELO_TESTNET_RPC_URL` and `CELO_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY`. You can obtain the RPC URL and a private key by creating a Celo wallet and selecting the "Testnet" network. Then, create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

```makefile
CELO_TESTNET_RPC_URL=<your RPC URL>
CELO_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=<your private key>
```

Go ahead and compile it with the command given below:

```bash
    npx hardhat compile
```

This will compile the Smart Contract and generate the artifacts in the artifacts directory.

Next, let's write some tests for the Smart Contract. Create a new file named `votingSystem.test.js` in the test directory and add the following code:

```javacript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("VotingSystem Test Suit", function () {
  let votingSystem;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    const VotingSystem = await ethers.getContractFactory("VotingSystem");

    try {
      votingSystem = await VotingSystem.deploy();
      await votingSystem.deployed();
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  });

  it("should initialize with zero total votes", async function () {
    try {
      expect(await votingSystem.getRemainingVotes()).to.equal(10_000_000_000_000_000_000);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  });

  it("should allow a user to vote", async function () {
    const [user] = await ethers.getSigners();

    const amount = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000;

    try {
      await expect(votingSystem.connect(user).vote(amount))
        .to.emit(votingSystem, "Voted")
        .withArgs(user.address, amount);

      expect(await votingSystem.getRemainingVotes()).to.equal(10_000_000_000_000_000_000 - amount);
      expect(await votingSystem.getVotes(user.address)).to.equal(amount);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  });

  it("should not allow a user to vote with zero amount", async function () {
    const [user] = await ethers.getSigners();

    try {
      await expect(votingSystem.connect(user).vote(0)).to.be.revertedWith("Amount must be greater than zero");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  });

  it("should not allow a user to vote with insufficient votes", async function () {
    const [user1, user2] = await ethers.getSigners();

    const amount = 20_000_000_000_000_000_000;

    try {
      await votingSystem.connect(user1).vote(amount);

      await expect(votingSystem.connect(user2).vote(amount))
        .to.be.revertedWith("Not enough votes remaining");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  });
});

```

The `beforeEach` function deploys a fresh instance of the `Voting` contract before each test.

The first test checks if the contract initializes with the correct number of total votes.

The second test checks if a user can vote and if the contract updates the user's vote balance and the total number of votes correctly.

The third test checks if the contract rejects a vote with zero amount.

The fourth test checks if the contract rejects a vote with an amount greater than the remaining votes.

## Deploying the Smart Contract:

Now that you have written and tested the Smart Contract, you can deploy it to the Celo network. Run the following command to deploy the contract:

```bash
    npx hardhat run --network celotestnet scripts/deploy.js
```

This will deploy the contract to the Celo network and print the contract address to the console.

## Conclusion:

Therefore, in this tutorial we have explored how to secure Smart Contracts on the Celo blockchain using the Mythril tool. We have also covered best practices for writing secure Smart Contracts like using `require` statements for input validation and keeping sensitive data private. By following these practices and using tools like Mythril to analyze your code, you can help ensure the security and integrity of your Smart Contracts on the blockchain.
